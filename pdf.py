Payday Platform Design Plan (Responsive Web App Only)

1. Tech Stack

Frontend (Responsive Web App)
- Framework: React.js (with TypeScript)
- UI Library: Material-UI or Ant Design
- State Management: Redux Toolkit
- Real-Time Updates: Socket.IO
- USSD Simulation: Custom UI mimicking USSD menus

Backend
- Language: Node.js (Express.js)
- Database: PostgreSQL (relational data) + Redis (caching)
- Authentication: OAuth2/JWT + SMS/Email OTP
- APIs: RESTful for core features, Webhooks for payroll sync
- Payment Gateway: EcoCash/OneMoney APIs, ZimSwitch for banks

DevOps & Infrastructure
- Hosting: AWS EC2 or Google Cloud
- Containerization: Docker + Kubernetes (scaling)
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions
- Monitoring: Prometheus + Grafana

2. System Architecture

Frontend (React)
 |
 V
API Gateway (Express.js)
 |
 |- Auth Service (JWT, OTP)
 |- Payment Service (EcoCash/OneMoney integration)
 |- Payroll Sync Service (Employer API/webhook)
 |- USSD Proxy Service (Telco APIs)
 |- Admin Service (RBAC, Reporting)
 |
 V
PostgreSQL - Users, Transactions, Employers
Redis - Session caching, real-time balance updates

3. Core Features & Implementation

3.1 Employee Web App
- User Auth:
  - Signup via employer-generated code + OTP
  - Passwordless login (SMS/email magic links)
- Dashboard:
  - Real-time earned wage balance (WebSocket updates)
  - Withdrawal form (amount selector, mobile money/bank picker)
- USSD Simulation:
  - React-based UI replicating USSD menus for feature phone users.
- Transaction History:
  - Filterable table with withdrawal/deduction records.

3.2 Employer Dashboard
- Payroll Integration:
  - CSV upload for bulk employee onboarding.
  - API endpoints for payroll systems (e.g., Sage, Pastel).
- Policy Management:
  - Slider for setting max withdrawal % (e.g., 30-50%).
  - Deduction schedule calendar.

3.3 Admin Panel
- Fraud Detection:
  - Flag withdrawals >X% of salary or frequent requests.
- KYC Verification:
  - National ID scan upload + liveness check (AWS Rekognition).

4. Security Design

- Data Encryption:
  - AES-256 for PII (national IDs, bank details).
  - TLS 1.3 for all API calls.
- Access Control:
  - Employees: JWT + OTP for withdrawals.
  - Employers: IP whitelisting + API keys.
  - Admins: Hardware tokens (YubiKey).
- Audit Logs:
  - Track all withdrawal requests, admin actions, and payroll syncs.

5. Workflow Implementation

Salary Withdrawal Flow (API Sequence):
1. POST /withdraw -> Check balance + daily limit.
2. Lock balance via Redis.
3. Call EcoCash API -> Disburse funds.
4. On success: Log transaction + send SMS.
5. On failure: Unlock balance + retry logic.

Payroll Deduction Sync:
1. Employerâ€™s payroll system sends POST /sync at month-end.
2. Deduct total advances from gross salary.
3. Generate payslip PDF with Payday deductions.

6. Development Roadmap

Phase 1 (MVP - 3 Months):
- Core employee dashboard (balance, withdrawals).
- Employer CSV upload + basic policy settings.
- EcoCash API integration.

Phase 2 (6 Months):
- USSD UI simulation.
- Auto-sync with payroll APIs (Sage/Pastel).
- Admin fraud detection dashboard.

Phase 3 (12 Months):
- Multi-bank support (ZimSwitch).
- AI-driven salary advance recommendations.

7. Compliance Steps

1. Register with RBZ fintech sandbox.
2. Partner with KYC provider (e.g., Smile Identity).
3. Legal review of employer deduction agreements.
